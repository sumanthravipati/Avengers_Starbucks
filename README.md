### Design decisions

We have choosen MVC design architecture. Advantages of using MVC architecture:
 
1. Faster Application Development Process:
 
MVC offers support for rapid and parallel development. So, developing applications using the MVC model helps to provide parallel implementation of different components without any dependencies. This helps for easy implementation of the business logic of the application. Also, it allows the developers to complete the application much quicker delivering the efficient solution in a timely manner.
 
2. MVC Application Supports Asynchronous Technique:
 
MVC also allows using the asynchronous technique, which allows web developers to build faster loading web apps providing better user experience.
 
3. Offers The Multiple Views:
 
In the MVC architecture, it is possible to create multiple views for a model. This provides developers to allow their users accessing the application in new and different ways. Furthermore, in this method, Code duplication is certainly less as it can separate data and business logic from the display.
 
4. Ideal for Developing large sized Application:
 
It works well for developing applications which need to be supported by large teams of developers. This can allow developers to easily extend their application in the future if need arises. Thus, the application will be extendible 

5. MVC Model Returns the Data Without the Need of Formatting:
 
It is helpful for the developers because the same components can be used and called for use with any interface. For example, any types of data can be formatted using HTML, but with MVC framework you can also format using the Macromedia Flash or Dream viewer.
 
6. The Modification Never Affects the Entire Model:
 
It is obvious that you make minor changes in a web application such as like changing colors, screen layouts, fonts and adding an extra support for mobile phones or tablets. Furthermore, adding a new type of views is very easy in MVC pattern as Model part does not depend on the views part. So, any changes in the Model will never affect the entire architecture.
